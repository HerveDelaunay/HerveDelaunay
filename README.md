# Herv√© Delaunay

I know my way around Linux and I love working with containers, I also like to create things with Typescript. I mainly work on Kubernetes and Azure.

## Kubernetes Homelab

I host applications on nodes running in my closet. I follow a GitOps workflow with FluxCD.

## Languages and Tools:

### Kubernetes

I fell in love with that technology the first time I launched a rolling update. After using it for some time I certified as a kubernetes administrator.

### Azure

I've decided to focus on Azure ecosystem and to specialise on it. I am currently chasing the Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104) certification.

### Python

Incredible versatility, easy to use without lacking depth. I've built a selenium bot for my previous work, entirely written in Python.
